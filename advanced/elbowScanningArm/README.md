# Pipe Elbow Scanning Arm

The code here is for an 8-DoF arm designed to investigate the feasibility of automatically scanning a pipe elbow for NDT inspection.  There are scripts that register to and raster a pipe, as well as scripts that do a general purpose teach-repeat and visualize feedback from the arm.
