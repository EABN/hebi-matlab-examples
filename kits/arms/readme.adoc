# HEBI Robotics Kits - Arms

This folder contains examples for controlling arm-type configurations such as the 5-DoF and 6-DoF X-Series arm kits.

*API Version: 1.0*

## Setup

### Load Libraries

These examples make use of a variety of HEBI libraries. In order to load the libraries correctly, please run `startup()` after starting up MATLAB.

Currently bundled APIs include

* hebi-matlab-1.0-rev1908 (link:http://docs.hebi.us[source])
* matlab-input-1.2 (link:https://github.com/HebiRobotics/MatlabInput/releases[source])

### Setup Robot

Open the `setupArm()` function and modify it to match your specific robot configuration. You can find tutorials on defining the kinematic structure on the online link:http://docs.hebi.us[documentation]. 

## Examples

At the top of each file is a `setup` section that may expose options for testing different behaviors.
